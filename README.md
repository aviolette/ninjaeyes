ninjaeyes
=========

Make ninjablock eyes turn colors based on how many food trucks are on the road...'cause why not?  Run this code in a cron job like this:

> node /path/to/ninja.js food-truck-finder-app-key ninja-blocks-access-token ninja-eyes-device-id

Where:

* food-truck-finder-app-key is an application key provided by the Chicago Food Truck Finder administrator
* ninja-blocks-access-token is something you generate from the ninja blocks dashboard
* ninja-eyes-device-id is the unique device ID of your ninja block's eyes
